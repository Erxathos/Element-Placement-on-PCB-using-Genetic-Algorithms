# Placement 

This is my bachelor diploma project. 

Placement of constructive elements on a printed circuit board using genetical algorithm. 

The program was developed in 2016 using Unity3d and C# implementation of the genetical algorithm. 

In Unity GUI and 3d visualisation of the result are realized.

Two criteria are used to place elements: power dissipation (the heat dissipation of the elements
should not damage nearby elements) and the total length of interconnections (should be small as possible).
